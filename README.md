# Jac-Ahn-Project-1-Flash-Cards


// APPROACH
Started with HTML bones. 
Looked for img of index card to put questions on. Found one.
Looked for "flip" animations for javascript and jquery. Found one from nattawat on github, and fiddled around with it, but could not get it to work with my image.
Settled on some basic css and got flip plug-in to work.
Started coding with HTML, put some divs in for the card and the button.
Coded the css, fiddled with the locations of the divs.
Wrangled with the script. Made a click event for the "Next question" button, so the button would cycle through the questions.
Learned about a click counter to cycle between the arrays. Added a checkbox so the user could click it to go through those questions again. Made an event listener for the checkbox. Wrote an if statement so the checked questions would be put in a new culled array. The checked questions would be presented again.
