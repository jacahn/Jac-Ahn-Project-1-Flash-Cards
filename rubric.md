## Project Workflow
Progressing - Although I see a pretty decent readme. I'm not seeing any userstories or wireframes. I'm sure you did adequate planning, but make sure you put it in your repo for the next project!

## Technical Requirements
Performing - Great job incorporating the checkbox! That was a really cool feature. Other than that, all tech requirements have been met. Would be cool to have a reset function as well as the ability to go to previous questions.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code for the most part is properly indented. Script file is pretty well commented! Which is great. Remember to leave out any commented code and console.logs in your final product.

## Creativity Interface
Performing. Styles are nice and simple. Here are some suggestions.
- Make a fixed height and width for the card.
- The ability to go back and forth from cards
- reset function with ability to randomize
- hitting the next button goes to next cards question rather than answer
